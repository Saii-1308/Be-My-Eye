# Be-My-Eye
The Be-My-Eye project is designed to assist visually impaired individuals through real-time object detection and voice feedback.
The system integrates advanced computer vision techniques to detect and recognize objects across multiple applications:

Document Reading: Uses optical character recognition (OCR) to extract and read out text from documents, making information accessible.
Grocery Detection: Identifies common grocery items, enabling easier navigation and selection in stores.
Currency Identification: Recognizes various banknotes, helping users differentiate between currency denominations.
This project leverages Teachable Machine for training machine learning models, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience. 
Built using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, the Be-My-Eye system offers a modular and scalable solution, combining object detection and voice output to empower blind individuals in their daily lives.
